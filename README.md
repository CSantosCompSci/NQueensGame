# NQueensGame
Queens game problem

The N-Queens problem is a popular puzzle. Assume that you have an NxN chessboard, and N queens. The problem asks you to place all N queens on the board so that no queen can attack another queen. Two queens are attacking (conflicting with) each other if they are on the same row, or same column, or the same diagonal.
